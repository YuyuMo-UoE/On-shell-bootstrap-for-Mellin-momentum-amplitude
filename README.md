## Bootstrap Codes for Mellin-Momentum Amplitudes

The codes documenting the bootstrap process for Mellin-momentum amplitudes can be found in the paper by [Jiajie Mei, Mellin-momentum amplitudes formalism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13894).

- **\texttt{4ym.nb}**: Four-point Yang-Mills (YM)
- **\texttt{4gr.nb}**: Four-point General Relativity (GR)
- **\texttt{5ym.nb}**: Five-point YM
- **\texttt{5gr.nb}**: Five-point GR

### Authors:
- Jiajie Mei

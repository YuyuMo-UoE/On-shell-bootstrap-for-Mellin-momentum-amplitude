## Bootstrap Codes for Mellin-Momentum Amplitudes

The codes documenting the bootstrap process for Mellin-momentum amplitudes can be found in the following files


- **`4ym.nb`**: Four-point Yang-Mills (YM)
- **`4gr.nb`**: Four-point General Relativity (GR)
- **`5ym.nb`**: Five-point YM
- **`5gr.nb`**: Five-point GR
- **`mm amp bootstrap.zip`** contains all precomputed data for 5 point graviton bootstrap,
  
  including final result  **`GR5fullADS`**. If one wants to run 5gr.nb, one can unzip the files to the same directory with **`5gr.nb`**
